                <h3>Affordable and transparent</h3>
                <p>At Chainstack, we understand the challenges of budgeting for engineering costs. That’s why we’ve
                    worked closely with hundreds of developers and customers to create a pricing structure that is fair,
                    transparent, and predictable. There’s no need to worry about guessing or estimating compute units as
                    our pricing eliminates hidden fees, and what you use is what you pay for, with no exceptions.</p>
                <p>All requests are treated equally, regardless of computation resources, making it easy for
                    organizations to budget and pay as they grow. Our unique pricing model counts all requests as 1x,
                    regardless of weight, size, or type of method being used. This means you can save up to 10x in costs
                    compared to other providers in the market, and our current customers have already saved thousands of
                    dollars every month.</p>
